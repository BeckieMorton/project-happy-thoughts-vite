# Happy Thoughts

Week 7 - Practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API in a "twitter" like app called "Happy Thoughts".

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem: understanding the useEffect hook was more difficult for me that the useState hook that was studied last week. While going through the content, I coded along with the code coaches and compelted the team exercise before class.

My main problem in this app was to get the like/heart counter working. I had difficulty understanding the correct syntax for a fetch POST request and spent many hours practicing. I still do not understand in which line of code the actual data is sent to the API on POST. 

How did you plan?: I first created my initial component structure, I decided to keep one .css file. When I decided to add the time/date information I created a new component.

What tools and techniques you used to solve it.  

What technologies did you use?: HTML5, CSS3, React, with Editor: VS Code

If you had more time, what would be next?: I would love to add a counter for the user to show how many likes they have made. This would remain updated even when they closed the program.
