# Happy Thoughts

Week 7 - Practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API in a "twitter" like app called "Happy Thoughts".

### The Problem

<ins>Describe how you approached to problem</ins>: understanding the useEffect hook was more difficult for me that the useState hook that was studied last week. While going through the content, I coded along with the code coaches and compelted the team exercise before class.

My main problem in this app was to get the like/heart counter working. I had difficulty understanding the correct syntax for a fetch POST request and spent many hours practicing. I still do not understand in which line of code the actual data is sent to the API on POST. 

<ins>How did you plan?</ins>: I first created my initial component structure, I decided to keep one .css file. When I decided to add the time/date information I created a new component. 

<ins>What technologies did you use?</ins>: HTML5, CSS3, React, with Editor: VS Code

<ins>If you had more time, what would be next?</ins>: I would love to add a counter for the user to show how many likes they have made. This would remain updated even when they closed the program.
